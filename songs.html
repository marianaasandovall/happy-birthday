          tell me what's on your mind<br>
          for you, i'd die a thousand times<br>
          find you in every life<br>
          for you, i'd dive into your tears<br>
          and swim the deepest sea<br>
          my baby, ain't nothing in this world<br>
          that means more to me<br>
          not anything<br>
          and just as constant as the air i breathe<br>
          i'd do anything to keep my baby safe<br>
          whatever it takes<br>
          love is a gun<br>
          i'll bite the bullet<br>
          wasn't that enough for you?<br>
          i'd do it again<br>
          somehow, it's good for the soul<br>
          yeah, if i could<br>
          i'd bite the bullet<br>
          what i would do<br>
          it's all for you<br><br>

          don't play with my heart<br>
          that's like playing with an open blade<br>
          for you, i'd dive into your brain<br>
          i would take all your pain<br>
          for you, i'd wrap my heart around you<br>
          there's no greater love<br>
          not anything<br>
          and long as blood is running through my veins<br>
          even in the afterlife, i'll always keep my baby safe<br><br>

          love is a gun<br>
          i'll bite the bullet<br>
          wasn't that enough for you?<br>
          i'd do it again<br>
          somehow, it's good for the soul<br>
          yeah, if i could<br>
          i'd bite the bullet<br>
          what i would do<br>
          it's all for you<br>
          all for you<br>
          it's all for you, you<br>
          all for you<br>
          it's all for you<br>
